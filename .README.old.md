## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Metal Rate Management System built with the MERN stack. It provides functionalities for user authentication, managing metal purities, and tracking the historical rates of metals based on their purity. The system is designed with a clean user interface using React and Material-UI, a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express, and a flexible NoSQL database using MongoDB.

## Features

### Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Static Metal Master**: Manages a static list of metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum) used throughout the application.
- **Purity Management (CRUD)**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for metal purity records. Each purity is linked to a specific metal.
- **Metal Rate Management**:
    - Allows users to input new rates for a specific metal and purity combination.
    - Displays the most recent rate when a metal/purity is selected.
    - **Saves all rate entries as new documents** to maintain a complete and accurate rate history.

### Bonus Features Implemented
- **Rate History**: View a paginated history of all metal rates.
- **Search and Filter**: Implemented server-side search and filtering for metal rates based on the metal type.
- **Server-Side Pagination**: The metal rate history is paginated for efficient data handling and a smooth user experience.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the backend (root) directory.
    - Install the required npm packages:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder with your actual MongoDB connection string.
      ```
      PORT=5000
      MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>
      JWT_SECRET=access-key
      ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    - Navigate to the frontend directory (assuming it's in a `frontend` or `client` folder within the root, or adjust as needed).
    - Install the required npm packages:
      ```sh
      npm install
      ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - From the root directory, run:
      ```sh
      npm start
      ```
    - The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    - From the frontend/client directory, run:
      ```sh
      npm start
      ```
    - The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now register a new user, log in, and start using the application.
